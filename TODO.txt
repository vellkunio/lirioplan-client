Tile, waterproof, cement, marbel ceals, shower floor, drains, cement posts, cement bases, 


1 bag = 50sqft cement

underlayment cement 1 bag = 50sqft (top and under) FLOOR ONLY
0.5inch tile = 50sqft/1bag
0.25 = 100sqft/1bag

0.01inch = 4sqft/1bag

0.01inch = 400sqft/1bag
1inch = 25 sqft/bag

25/thickness = size of sqft it can cover per bag

amount of bags = sizeOFSurface / (25/thickness)

------------------

Waterproof = 1 gallon = 100sqft

Option 1:

Create list of all material possible
	- if have in stock - number, if emply in stock - 0
	- Will have a unique number
When create a project will use dropdown for all materials needed
	- Devide this number from materials
	- If negavite = TO BUY
	- If positive = good



Option 2:

If project will have an open tab materials with list of needed materials and prices

Summarize all prices + for job and calculate total price
	-Total price - materials = clean income

Calculate all math for needed cement and waterproof and add to materials tab


Option 3: 

When create a project will add materials needed with autofill from existing materials in DB for easier type
Materials connect to materials DB to display needed materials in Materials section
1) He has to add materials with all details
2) Pick this material from dropdown when create a project
3) In project see list of materials needed with prices


Rules: 
	If this material is not needed in any projects => Display q-ty of 0 => 
	=> Otherwise show amount of total needed this material in all projects

Math:

When create a project will have 2 fields
	
	If shower field => ask for thickness of tile => calculate waterproof and cement
	If floor field => ask for thickness of tile => Calculate underlayment cement and cement
	If walls field => calculate cement
	


Finance:

Add gross income => All total money for finished project
Clean income => Add money after project checkmark is on 'IsFullyPaid'
Expenses => All costs of materials
Amount of active projects => Project with checkmark off 'IsFinished'
Amount to Finished Projects => Projects with checkmark on 'finished'
Top 3 company that has most installed projects (Millsone, Private jobs, other)
Custom add income field
Custom Expences field

0) ClientSide
1) Array of materials must stay in redux store
2) Aceess that array in create Project & createMaterial (to avoid ducpicates)
3) Add open section to add materials to the project
4) Add fields with autofill from array
5) Add a button to Add more

6.0) Functions
6.1) Post materials from inputs as array and in Funcs take each element and add to material q-ty
7) Get materials from DB to show in projects where material.projectId = project.projectId
